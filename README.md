# Unity-3D-Top-Down-Shooter-Sandbox

In this sandbox, I have created assets for a 3D Top Down Shooter game.

Right now the character :
- Can be controlled (move, sprint and rotate) with mouse and keyboard.
- Shoot ice projectile made with particle system.

Ennemies :
- Can follow the player.
- Can hit the player when close enought.

## About this Git :

I made this git in order to show my progresses in my self-learning trip as a game developper with Unity.
